learning about thhe CPSR register, print decimal numbers, and RASM-2 
    - modifying intasc64 (hex) to output decimal numbers 
        a. pseudo:

                ** basically ascint64 but backwards ** 

                decimal is 0 to 9. decimal 0 in ascii is 0x30(ascii) or 48(ascii)
                use as an offset to go through num 0-9(decimal) 
                12 in hex is 18 decimal. 

                FF is largest number we can deal with.
                - 12(x16) / A = 1 R8. store 1, add 1 to ascii number for character
                - subracting from x - (base10num)*y 
                - need to start on the largest end, limiting factor is signed numbers. 
                - largest num we can have is 64 bits. first is either 0 or 1, and we have
                  the other 63 bits to work with. if negative .. 

                  R0 holds value to be converted
                  R1 points to address for string to be stored
                  LR: contains return address.

    in CPSR: leftmost byte is the 4 bits we will be reading
